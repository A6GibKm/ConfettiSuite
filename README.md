# The Confetti Suite

The Ultimate confetti suite for prot warriors.

The Confetti Suite shows tasteful confetti when a shield slams hits for over a million.

### New aditions

Added an option to show % of meele hits blocked after combat, due to problem with the combat log API this number will be around 0.5-1% lower than the number on warcraftlogs. Have in mind that warcraft logs also makes mistakes and sometimes it shows more hits that the ones that actually existed.

Added an option to show spell reflected abilities.

### Installation

To install place the ConfettiSuite folder inside 
`..."WoW Directory"\Interface\AddOns\"PLACE IT HERE"`

### Usage

Type `/confetti` or `/cft` to open the configuration window (work in progress)
