# The Confetti Suite

This World of Warcraft addon provides the Ultimate confetti suite for protection warriors.

The Confetti Suite shows tasteful confetti when a shield slams hits for over a million.

### New aditions

Added an option to show % of meele hits blocked after combat, due to problem with the combat log API this number will be strictly lower than the number on warcraftlogs (around 0.5-1% for a 6 min fight). Have in mind that warcraft logs also makes mistakes and sometimes it shows more hits that the ones that actually existed (hits not shown in the in-game combat log).

Added an option to show spell reflected abilities.

### Installation

To install place the ConfettiSuite folder inside 
`..."WoW Directory"\Interface\AddOns\"PLACE IT HERE"`

### Usage

Type `/confetti` or `/cft` to open the configuration window (work in progress)
